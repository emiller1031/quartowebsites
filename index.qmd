I am a Chicago-based aspiring urban planner with an interest in climate change adaptation. I will graduate from the University of Illinois Chicago's Master of Urban Planning and Policy program in May 2024, and I am seeking professional opportunities relating to zoning, civic technology, GIS, and data visualization.
